 	<p>Humans are definitely my favorite animal. If I had to be stuck on a deserted island for any extended period of time, and I had to pick another animal to accompany me, it would be another human. </p>

 	<p> Humans are intelligent, compassionate, complex emotionally, intellectually engadging and so on. Basically I can relate with other humans much better than I can with any other animal.</p>
